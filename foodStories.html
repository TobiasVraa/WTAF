            <p> Excitement and enjoyment, quickly followed by anxiety and stress – uni can bring fluctuating emotions that change day by day, or even hour by hour. A bad mood can arrive with no explanation, while social pressures, a large workload, or lack of sleep may lead to low feelings.</p>
            <p>It’s tempting to turn to food and drink to get you through low moods and tiredness. But some foods work better than others. Here are a few tips.</p>

                <h3>What next?</h3>
                <p>It’s important not to demonise foods – sometimes that treat is exactly what you need. But it’s a good idea to understand how foods interact with your body and mental wellbeing so you can consider this when making choices. Simply eating regular, nutritious, meals, will help keep your sugar levels and mood more consistent.</p>

                    <h3>Eat plants not junk food</h3>
                    <p>Student accommodation is scattered with the remnants of junk food – delivery boxes tossed into the recycling, an empty noodle cup abandoned by the kettle, or fizzy drink bottles rolling around under the sofa. But despite their colourful packaging, these foods are unlikely to brighten your mood in the long term.</p>
                    <p>Junk food refers to pre-packaged foods high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, salt and/or sugar, with a low nutritional value. A diet high in junk food and fast food has been linked to inflammation, where the immune system is over stimulated. In turn, scientists have linked high levels of inflammation to mood disorders. Avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet, for example by eating a Mediterranean diet rich in vegetables, legumes and unsaturated fats, is associated with better mental health and some protection from depression.</p>
                    <p>There’s also evidence diet impacts mood through your gut microbiome. The gut and brain communicate with each other via the gut-brain axis, and disruption to the gut microbiome has been shown to impact mental health. This disruption can be caused by a diet high in saturated fats, sugar and/or ultra-processed foods.<br>So how do you maintain a healthy gut microbiome? </p>
                    <p>Think of your gut as a garden – a diverse range of flourishing species will invoke happier feelings than dried up grass. But instead of plants, your gut contains bacteria. To achieve this rich microbial ‘garden’, you need to feed your gut bacteria a variety of plants, such as wholegrains, legumes and vegetables, providing rich sources of fibre and other nutrients to help good bacteria thrive.</p>

                    <h3>Cooking can be relaxing</h3>
                    <p>Cooking can seem like a burden. Life on a student budget probably means opening the fridge doesn’t hit you with inspiration, and many students will recognise that slightly off-smell of a fridge that should have been cleared out ages ago.</p>
                    <p>Students often settle for a lot of meal repetition. I had a friend who rarely ventured further than a jacket potato with tuna. But this doesn’t have to be the case – ask your flatmates for ideas and scroll through recipes online. Once you’ve got your recipe, it’s time to relax.</p>
                    <p>I find following a recipe calming. Focusing on completing one step at a time is a good distraction from the day’s worries. It’s not just the sense of achievement that comes with making a delicious meal that can boost your mood, but all the little motions along the way.<br>
                    The satisfaction of a sharp knife gliding through vegetables, the noise of boiling water, the meditative motion of stirring a bubbling pan as the aroma fills the kitchen. I guess the only downside is there will always be washing up, but maybe that can be relaxing too?</p>
